# Chronia

## Purpose of This Project

Chronia provides functions for easily manipulating dates and times in Node.js/JavaScript.
This library has the following features:

- Manipulates the standard Date object
- Provides only side-effect-free functions
- Written in TypeScript for type safety, with additional validation for safe use when called from JavaScript
- Implements only frequently used features, aiming for a lightweight library independent of other libraries
