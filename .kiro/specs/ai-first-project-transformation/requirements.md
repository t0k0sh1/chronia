# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the transformation of the Chronia date/time utility library into an AI-first project. The transformation involves restructuring documentation, improving AI comprehension of the codebase, and establishing clear guidelines for AI-assisted development and code review processes.

## Glossary

- **Chronia_Library**: The TypeScript date/time utility library being transformed
- **AI_Agent**: Any artificial intelligence system (including GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) that interacts with the codebase
- **Site_Directory**: The renamed directory containing generated TypeDoc documentation for public consumption
- **Docs_Directory**: The new directory containing markdown files specifically designed for AI comprehension
- **Copilot_Instructions**: The GitHub Copilot configuration file providing project context and development guidelines
- **AGENTS_File**: The AGENTS.md file that consolidates references to all AI-related documentation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to preserve existing generated documentation while making it clearly distinct from AI-focused documentation, so that users can still access comprehensive API documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chronia_Library SHALL rename the existing docs directory to site directory
2. THE site directory SHALL continue to contain all generated TypeDoc documentation
3. THE site directory SHALL remain accessible for public API documentation consumption
4. THE site directory SHALL be clearly distinguished from the new docs directory in project structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want access to structured documentation about individual functions and their usage patterns, so that I can provide accurate code suggestions and examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chronia_Library SHALL create a docs directory containing markdown files for AI consumption
2. THE docs directory SHALL include function reference documentation organized by the 10 function categories (arithmetic, comparison, difference, getter, setter, boundary, truncation, formatting, utility, constants)
3. THE docs directory SHALL provide usage examples and common patterns for each function category
4. THE docs directory SHALL include troubleshooting guides and common pitfalls for AI reference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want clear documentation about the library's structure and purpose, so that I can provide accurate assistance with development tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI_Agent accesses the project, THE Chronia_Library SHALL provide a comprehensive README.md that explains both human and AI-oriented project information
2. THE README.md SHALL include sections specifically designed for AI comprehension including library overview, function categories, and usage patterns
3. THE README.md SHALL maintain existing human-readable content while adding AI-specific context
4. THE README.md SHALL reference the location of additional AI documentation resources
5. THE README.md SHALL include links from each function category section to corresponding documentation files in the docs directory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using GitHub Copilot, I want the AI to understand the project's architecture and coding standards, so that it provides contextually appropriate suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chronia_Library SHALL update the existing .github/copilot-instructions.md file to include comprehensive project structure and development guidelines
2. THE .github/copilot-instructions.md file SHALL include detailed directory structure explanations
3. THE .github/copilot-instructions.md file SHALL specify coding standards, testing approaches, and architectural patterns specific to the Chronia library
4. THE .github/copilot-instructions.md file SHALL provide code review guidelines and quality standards for TypeScript date/time utility functions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want a single entry point to understand all AI-related documentation, so that I can quickly access relevant project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chronia_Library SHALL create an AGENTS.md file that consolidates AI documentation references
2. THE AGENTS.md SHALL reference the CLAUDE.md file for Claude-specific guidance
3. THE AGENTS.md SHALL provide links to all AI-relevant documentation files
4. THE AGENTS.md SHALL include a brief overview of how different AI systems should interact with the project
