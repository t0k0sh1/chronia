<!--
  TEMPLATE USAGE:

  1. The [Unreleased] section (lines 15-24) is for ongoing development.
     Developers manually add entries here during development.

  2. The {{VERSION}} section (lines 26-35) is a template for release preparation.
     The /release:prepare command uses this structure when creating new version sections.
     {{VERSION}} is replaced with actual version (e.g., "1.2.3")
     {{DATE}} is replaced with release date (e.g., "2024-12-01")

  3. During release preparation:
     - Content from [Unreleased] is promoted to a new version section
     - [Unreleased] is reset to empty subsections for future development
