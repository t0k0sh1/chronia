# Markdownlint Configuration for Skills

This directory contains Claude Code Skills with specific Markdown linting rules.

## Disabled Rules

### MD013 (Line Length)

**Why disabled**: Skills contain detailed technical explanations, code examples, and JSDoc blocks that often exceed 80 characters. Enforcing line length would reduce readability by forcing awkward line breaks in:

- Function signatures with multiple parameters
- Code examples with nested logic
- Detailed technical descriptions
- Error messages and validation patterns

### MD041 (First Line Heading Level)

**Why disabled**: All Skills use YAML frontmatter (delimited by `---`) at the top of the file, which prevents the first line from being a heading. This frontmatter contains essential metadata (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`) that must appear before the document content.

## Enabled Rules

All other Markdownlint rules remain enabled to ensure:

- Consistent heading hierarchy (MD025, MD001)
- Proper list formatting (MD029, MD030)
- Code block syntax highlighting (MD040)
- Proper link formatting (MD039, MD042)
