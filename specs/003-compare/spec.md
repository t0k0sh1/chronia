# Feature Specification: Compare Function Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `003-compare`
**Created**: 2024-09-23
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "compare�pn��"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the chronia date/time utility library, I need a compare function that allows me to determine the relative order between two Date objects with configurable sort direction, so that I can sort dates in ascending or descending order, implement date-based logic, and perform chronological comparisons in my applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two valid Date objects with different timestamps, **When** I call compare(date1, date2), **Then** I receive a numeric result indicating their relative order (-1, 0, or 1) in ascending order
2. **Given** two valid Date objects with identical timestamps, **When** I call compare(date1, date2), **Then** I receive 0 indicating they are equal
3. **Given** two valid Date objects and order="DESC", **When** I call compare(date1, date2, "DESC"), **Then** I receive the reverse comparison result for descending order
4. **Given** invalid Date objects, **When** I call compare with them, **Then** the function throws a RangeError
5. **Given** non-Date arguments, **When** I call compare, **Then** the function throws a RangeError
6. **Given** I need to sort an array of dates, **When** I use the compare function with Array.sort(), **Then** the dates are ordered chronologically according to the specified order

### Edge Cases
- Invalid Date objects (NaN timestamps) result in RangeError being thrown
- Null or undefined arguments result in RangeError being thrown
- Function works only with strict Date instances, not Date-like objects
- Invalid order parameter values result in RangeError being thrown
- What is the behavior when comparing dates at the boundaries of valid Date ranges?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a compare function that accepts two Date objects and an optional order parameter
- **FR-002**: System MUST return -1 when the first date is earlier than the second date (in ASC order)
- **FR-003**: System MUST return 1 when the first date is later than the second date (in ASC order)
- **FR-004**: System MUST return 0 when both dates represent the same moment in time
- **FR-005**: System MUST throw RangeError when either Date object is invalid (contains NaN timestamp)
- **FR-006**: System MUST throw RangeError when arguments are not Date objects (null, undefined, or other types)
- **FR-007**: System MUST accept optional third parameter "order" with values "ASC" or "DESC", defaulting to "ASC"
- **FR-008**: System MUST reverse comparison results when order="DESC" (return 1 for earlier date, -1 for later date)
- **FR-009**: System MUST throw RangeError when order parameter is not "ASC" or "DESC"
- **FR-010**: System MUST be compatible with standard JavaScript Array.sort() method for date sorting
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide consistent results across different environments (Node.js, browsers)
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle timezone information consistently within Date objects

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Date Objects**: JavaScript Date instances representing specific moments in time, must contain valid timestamps (no NaN values)
- **Comparison Result**: Numeric value (-1, 0, 1) indicating the relative chronological order between two dates
- **Order Parameter**: String value ("ASC" or "DESC") determining comparison direction, defaults to "ASC"
- **Sort Integration**: Compatibility with JavaScript's native sorting mechanisms for chronological ordering
- **Error Handling**: RangeError thrown for invalid inputs (non-Date objects, invalid dates, invalid order values)
