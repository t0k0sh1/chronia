# Research: getTime/setTime Implementation

## JavaScript Date Timestamp Best Practices

**Decision**: Direct implementation maintaining native compatibility

**Rationale**:
- JavaScript's Date.prototype.getTime() and Date.prototype.setTime() are well-established APIs
- Native behavior is extensively tested and reliable across environments
- Compatibility ensures seamless integration with existing JavaScript code
- Performance is optimal when leveraging native Date object internals

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Custom timestamp validation**:
   - Would require reimplementing Date range checking
   - Risk of inconsistencies with native behavior
   - Additional complexity without clear benefit

2. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Could provide more detailed error messages
   - Would break compatibility with native Date API
   - Users expect consistent behavior with standard JavaScript

## Edge Case Handling Patterns

**Key Findings**:

### Date.prototype.getTime() Behavior
- Returns NaN for invalid Date objects (e.g., `new Date("invalid")`)
- Always returns a number (never throws exceptions)
- Range: approximately Â±8.64e15 milliseconds from Unix epoch
- Handles all valid Date values including edge cases

### Date.prototype.setTime() Behavior
- Accepts any numeric value (including NaN, Infinity)
- Sets internal timestamp directly
- Returns the timestamp value that was set
- Creates invalid Date if given NaN or out-of-range values
- Modifies the original Date object

### Implementation Strategy
- Mirror native behavior exactly for compatibility
- No additional validation beyond what Date constructor provides
- Return types and error handling match native methods
- Function signatures follow TypeScript best practices

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Direct delegation to native Date methods

**Rationale**:
- Native Date methods are optimized at the engine level
- No additional overhead from custom validation
- Maintains O(1) performance characteristics
- Leverages browser/Node.js optimizations

## Type Safety Approach

**Decision**: TypeScript-first with runtime compatibility

**Implementation Details**:
- Accept Date objects as primary input type
- Return appropriate numeric types for timestamps
- Maintain compatibility with JavaScript usage patterns
- Provide clear JSDoc documentation for expected behavior

## Compatibility Requirements

**Standards Compliance**:
- ECMAScript Date specification compliance
- Cross-platform consistency (Node.js, browsers)
- Backward compatibility with existing JavaScript code
- Forward compatibility with future ECMAScript updates

## Testing Strategy

**Comprehensive Coverage**:
- Valid Date object scenarios
- Invalid Date object scenarios (NaN dates)
- Edge case timestamp values (min/max ranges)
- Boundary conditions and overflow handling
- Cross-reference with native Date behavior
- Performance benchmarks against native methods

## Security Considerations

**No Security Implications**:
- Pure timestamp manipulation functions
- No external data access or modification
- No user input processing beyond Date objects
- No persistent state or side effects
