# Feature Specification: getTime/setTime Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `002-gettime-settime`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "getTime/setTimen��"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the date utility library, I need to extract the timestamp value from a Date object and create Date objects from timestamp values, so that I can perform low-level date operations, store dates efficiently, compare dates numerically, and work with Unix timestamps and other time-based APIs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid Date object, **When** I call getTime(), **Then** I receive the corresponding timestamp in milliseconds since Unix epoch
2. **Given** a valid timestamp in milliseconds, **When** I call setTime() on a Date object, **Then** the Date object is updated to represent that timestamp
3. **Given** multiple Date objects with the same timestamp, **When** I call getTime() on each, **Then** all return identical numeric values
4. **Given** a Date object, **When** I call getTime() and then setTime() with the same value on another Date, **Then** both Date objects represent the same moment in time
5. **Given** an invalid Date object (e.g., new Date(NaN)), **When** I call getTime(), **Then** I receive NaN

### Edge Cases
- What happens when setTime() is called with NaN or Infinity?
- How does the system handle setTime() with values outside the valid Date range?
- What happens when getTime() is called on a Date that was constructed with invalid parameters?
- How does setTime() handle very large positive or negative timestamp values?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a getTime() function that extracts timestamp values from Date objects
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a setTime() function that updates Date objects with timestamp values
- **FR-003**: getTime() MUST return the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC
- **FR-004**: setTime() MUST accept a timestamp in milliseconds and update the Date object accordingly
- **FR-005**: getTime() MUST return NaN for invalid Date objects
- **FR-006**: setTime() MUST handle invalid input gracefully by creating an invalid Date when given NaN or invalid values
- **FR-007**: Functions MUST maintain compatibility with native JavaScript Date.prototype.getTime() and Date.prototype.setTime() behavior
- **FR-008**: Functions MUST handle the full range of valid JavaScript Date values (approximately �100,000,000 days from Unix epoch)
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate input parameters and return appropriate results for edge cases

### Key Entities
- **Date Object**: Represents a specific moment in time, containing internal timestamp value
- **Timestamp**: Numeric value representing milliseconds since Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC)
- **Unix Epoch**: Reference point for timestamp calculations (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC)
