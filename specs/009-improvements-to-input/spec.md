# Feature Specification: Improvements to Input Validation for clamp, compare, is*, and diff* Functions

**Feature Branch**: `009-improvements-to-input`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Improvements to Input Validation for clamp, compare, is*, and diff* Functions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: input validation improvements for date utility functions
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developers using chronia library
   → Actions: calling functions with various input types
   → Data: Date objects, numbers, invalid values
   → Constraints: type safety, consistent error handling
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Clarified: Use existing isValidDate, isValidNumber, isValidDateOrNumber validators
   → Clarified: Maintain current behavior - no new string conversion or null handling
   → Clarified: Standardize validation approach without changing external behavior
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flows for valid and invalid inputs identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement is testable with specific input/output expectations
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Input types, validation rules, error responses
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clarified and success criteria defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the chronia library, I want all date utility functions (clamp, compare, is*, diff*) to use the standardized internal validation functions (isValidDate, isValidNumber, isValidDateOrNumber) for consistent input checking, while maintaining the same external behavior and user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer calls any date function with valid Date objects, **When** the function executes, **Then** it should process normally without validation errors
2. **Given** a developer calls any date function with Invalid Date objects, **When** the function executes, **Then** it should handle the invalid input consistently (either return Invalid Date or throw descriptive error)
3. **Given** a developer calls any date function with wrong input types (string, boolean, null), **When** the function executes, **Then** it should provide clear error messages indicating the expected input type
4. **Given** a developer calls a comparison function with mixed valid/invalid dates, **When** the function executes, **Then** it should detect and report which specific input is invalid
5. **Given** a developer calls a range function (clamp) with min > max, **When** the function executes, **Then** it should either auto-correct the range or throw a descriptive error

### Edge Cases
- What happens when timestamp numbers are valid but outside JavaScript Date range?
- How does system handle NaN, Infinity, -Infinity as numeric inputs?
- What should occur when optional parameters have invalid types?
- How should functions behave with Date objects that have valid structure but invalid time values?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: All date utility functions MUST validate input types before processing
- **FR-002**: Functions MUST provide consistent validation behavior across the entire library
- **FR-003**: Invalid Date objects MUST be detected and handled appropriately in all functions
- **FR-004**: Type errors MUST include descriptive messages indicating expected vs actual input types
- **FR-005**: Range validation errors (like min > max in clamp) MUST provide actionable error messages
- **FR-006**: Functions accepting numeric timestamps MUST validate for finite numbers only
- **FR-007**: Comparison functions MUST validate all date parameters before performing comparisons
- **FR-008**: Functions MUST maintain current behavior for all input types (no new string conversion support)
- **FR-009**: Functions MUST preserve existing null/undefined handling behavior per function
- **FR-010**: Validation standardization MUST not introduce performance regressions beyond 5% of current execution time

### Success Criteria
- **SC-001**: 100% of clamp, compare, is*, and diff* functions use standardized internal validators
- **SC-002**: All existing test cases continue to pass without modification
- **SC-003**: Performance regression stays within 5% of baseline execution time
- **SC-004**: Code coverage for validation paths reaches 95% or maintains current level
- **SC-005**: Zero breaking changes to public API behavior

### Key Entities
- **Internal Validator Functions**: isValidDate, isValidNumber, isValidDateOrNumber used for input validation
- **Function Categories**: clamp, compare, is*, diff* functions requiring validation standardization
- **Validation Consistency**: Uniform validation approach across all target functions
- **Behavioral Preservation**: Maintaining exact current behavior while improving internal implementation
