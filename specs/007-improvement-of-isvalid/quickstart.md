# Quickstart: Improvement of isValid

**Feature**: 007-improvement-of-isvalid | **Date**: 2025-09-27

## Overview

This quickstart guide validates the improved `isValid` function implementation. The improvement uses internal validation utilities (`isValidDateOrNumber`) instead of always creating Date objects, providing better performance while maintaining identical behavior.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Chronia library source code
- Vitest testing framework

## Validation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Current Implementation
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/chronia

# Run existing tests to establish baseline
npm test -- isValid
```

**Expected Result**: All existing tests should pass with current implementation.

### Step 2: Run Contract Tests (Pre-Implementation)
```bash
# Run the new contract tests - these should FAIL initially
npm test -- specs/007-improvement-of-isvalid/contracts/
```

**Expected Result**:
- ❌ Internal validator usage test should FAIL (not using isValidDateOrNumber yet)
- ❌ Performance optimization test should FAIL (still creating Date objects for invalid numbers)

### Step 3: Implement the Improvement
```typescript
// src/isValid/index.ts
import { isValidDateOrNumber } from "../_lib/validators";

/**
 * Check if the given value is a valid Date or timestamp.
 *
 * - Accepts a `Date` object or a timestamp (number).
 * - Returns `true` if the resulting Date is valid, otherwise `false`.
 *
 * @param date - The Date object or timestamp to validate.
 * @returns `true` if valid, `false` if invalid.
 */
export function isValid(date: Date | number): boolean {
  return isValidDateOrNumber(date);
}
```

### Step 4: Verify Implementation
```bash
# Run all isValid tests to ensure behavior is maintained
npm test -- isValid

# Run contract tests to ensure they now pass
npm test -- specs/007-improvement-of-isvalid/contracts/
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ All existing isValid tests should still pass
- ✅ Contract tests should now pass
- ✅ Performance improvement should be measurable

### Step 5: Performance Verification
```bash
# Run performance-specific tests
npm test -- specs/007-improvement-of-isvalid/contracts/performance-optimization.test.ts
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Invalid number processing should be faster
- ✅ Valid input performance should be maintained or improved
- ✅ Performance consistency should be acceptable

### Step 6: Integration Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
npm test

# Run linting to ensure code quality
npm run lint

# Build to ensure no compilation issues
npm run build
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Build succeeds

## Verification Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] FR-001: Backward compatibility maintained (all existing tests pass)
- [ ] FR-002: Uses isValidDateOrNumber validator internally
- [ ] FR-003: Rejects NaN, Infinity, -Infinity without creating Date objects
- [ ] FR-004: Accepts both Date objects and numeric timestamps
- [ ] FR-005: Returns boolean and maintains public interface
- [ ] FR-006: Performance is equal or better than current implementation
- [ ] FR-007: Validation logic aligns with other library functions

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Import statement correctly references `../_lib/validators`
- [ ] Function signature unchanged: `(date: Date | number): boolean`
- [ ] JSDoc comments maintained and accurate
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] ESLint passes without errors

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Invalid numbers (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity) processed faster
- [ ] Valid Date objects maintain same performance
- [ ] Valid timestamps maintain same performance
- [ ] No performance regressions for any input type
- [ ] Memory usage not increased

### Test Coverage
- [ ] All 17 existing test cases continue to pass
- [ ] Contract tests pass after implementation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet expectations
- [ ] Integration tests show no regressions

## Success Criteria

The improvement is successful when:

1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality works identically
2. **Performance Improvement**: Measurable performance gains for invalid numeric inputs
3. **Code Quality**: Implementation follows library patterns and passes all quality checks
4. **Test Coverage**: All tests pass including new contract tests

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. Revert to original implementation:
   ```typescript
   export function isValid(date: Date | number): boolean {
     return !isNaN(new Date(date).getTime());
   }
   ```

2. Remove import statement for `isValidDateOrNumber`

3. Run full test suite to confirm rollback success

## Next Steps

After successful validation:

1. Update documentation if needed
2. Consider similar optimizations in other functions
3. Monitor performance in production usage
4. Document the improvement in changelog
