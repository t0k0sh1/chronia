# Feature Specification: Improvement of isValid

**Feature Branch**: `007-improvement-of-isvalid`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "improvement of isValid" - Use isValidDateOrNumber internally

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Chronia library, I need the isValid function to use consistent internal validation mechanisms that align with other library functions, ensuring better performance and maintainability while preserving the same validation behavior.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid Date object is provided, **When** isValid validates it, **Then** it returns true for valid dates and false for Invalid Date objects
2. **Given** a numeric timestamp is provided, **When** isValid validates it, **Then** it rejects infinite and NaN values efficiently before attempting conversion
3. **Given** the library uses shared validation utilities, **When** isValid employs the same validators as other functions, **Then** validation logic remains consistent across the codebase
4. **Given** invalid edge case values are provided, **When** isValid processes them, **Then** it avoids unnecessary object creation for known invalid inputs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when isValid receives NaN as input?
- How does the system handle Infinity and -Infinity values?
- What happens with extremely large or small timestamp values?
- How are Invalid Date objects handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility - all existing valid inputs must continue to return the same results
- **FR-002**: System MUST use the internal isValidDateOrNumber validator for initial input validation
- **FR-003**: System MUST reject NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity values without creating Date objects
- **FR-004**: System MUST continue to accept both Date objects and numeric timestamps as input
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain the same return type (boolean) and public interface
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure performance is equal to or better than current implementation
- **FR-007**: System MUST align validation logic with other date utility functions in the library
