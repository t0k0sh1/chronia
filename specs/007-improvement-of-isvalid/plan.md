# Implementation Plan: Improvement of isValid

**Branch**: `007-improvement-of-isvalid` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-improvement-of-isvalid/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Improve the isValid function implementation to use the internal isValidDateOrNumber validator instead of the current simple NaN check. This change will provide better performance by avoiding unnecessary Date object creation for invalid inputs while maintaining backward compatibility and aligning with other library validation patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Vitest (testing), ESLint (linting), TypeDoc (documentation)
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Vitest with table-driven tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Node.js, browsers, ESM/CJS)
**Project Type**: single - TypeScript utility library
**Performance Goals**: Maintain or improve current performance, avoid unnecessary object creation
**Constraints**: 100% backward compatibility, no breaking changes to public API
**Scale/Scope**: Single function improvement within existing utility library

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**No constitution file found** - proceeding with standard best practices:
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Follow existing code patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive testing required
- ✅ Documentation alignment
- ✅ Performance optimization acceptable

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - TypeScript utility library with standard src/ and tests/ structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **✅ Current implementation analysis**:
   - Analyzed existing isValid function in `src/isValid/index.ts`
   - Current approach: `!isNaN(new Date(date).getTime())`
   - Performance concern: Always creates Date objects

2. **✅ Target validator research**:
   - Analyzed isValidDateOrNumber in `src/_lib/validators.ts`
   - Uses type-specific validation (isValidDate + isValidNumber)
   - Provides performance optimization for invalid numbers

3. **✅ Compatibility analysis**:
   - Verified identical behavior for all test cases
   - Confirmed backward compatibility preservation
   - Validated integration with existing patterns

**Output**: ✅ research.md completed with implementation strategy

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **✅ Data model extraction** → `data-model.md`:
   - IsValidFunction entity with input/output types
   - InternalValidator entity mapping
   - ValidationBehavior constraints

2. **✅ Contract tests generation**:
   - `contracts/internal-validator-usage.test.ts`: Validates internal implementation
   - `contracts/performance-optimization.test.ts`: Validates performance improvements
   - Tests designed to FAIL before implementation

3. **✅ Validation scenarios** from requirements:
   - Backward compatibility verification
   - Performance optimization validation
   - Integration testing approach

4. **✅ Quickstart guide**:
   - Step-by-step validation process
   - Pre/post implementation verification
   - Success criteria and rollback plan

5. **⚠️ Agent file update**:
   - CLAUDE.md already exists and is current
   - No new technologies introduced in this improvement
   - Manual update not required for internal refactoring

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, ✅ contracts/*, ✅ quickstart.md, ⚠️ agent file (N/A)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Simple implementation task: single function modification
- Contract tests first (TDD approach)
- Validation of performance improvements
- Integration testing and quality assurance

**Ordering Strategy**:
- T001-T002: Setup and baseline verification
- T003-T004: Contract tests (must fail initially)
- T005: Core implementation (single line change)
- T006-T008: Validation and performance testing
- T009-T010: Quality assurance and documentation

**Estimated Output**: 8-10 focused tasks for this targeted improvement

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**No violations detected** - this improvement follows constitution principles:
- ✅ Maintains simplicity (single function, single line change)
- ✅ Uses existing internal utilities (no new complexity)
- ✅ Preserves backward compatibility
- ✅ Follows established patterns


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
