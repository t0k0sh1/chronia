# Feature Specification: Compare Function Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `010-improvement-of-compare`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "improvement of compare"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What specific comparison modes should the enhanced compare function support beyond basic ASC/DESC ordering? → A: A
- Q: How should the enhanced compare function handle timezone differences when comparing dates? → A: B
- Q: What are the specific performance targets for the enhanced compare function when sorting large datasets? → A: B

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Developers using the chronia library need enhanced comparison capabilities for Date objects that go beyond simple chronological ordering to support more sophisticated sorting and comparison scenarios in applications handling temporal data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two Date objects or numeric timestamps, **When** using the enhanced compare function, **Then** both Date and number input types should be handled consistently
2. **Given** a compare function call without a third argument, **When** comparing two dates, **Then** the function should default to ascending order without throwing an error
3. **Given** order parameters in various cases ("asc", "ASC", "desc", "DESC"), **When** comparing dates, **Then** the function should accept all case variations of order parameters
4. **Given** a collection of dates requiring sorting, **When** using the enhanced compare function, **Then** the function should maintain basic chronological ordering without additional complexity
5. **Given** dates in different local time representations, **When** comparing, **Then** the comparison should use local time consistently (preserving current behavior)
6. **Given** enhanced compare function with new capabilities, **When** updating project documentation, **Then** all user-facing documentation should reflect the new API signature and usage examples
7. **Given** backwards-incompatible changes to function signature, **When** running existing test suites, **Then** comprehensive test coverage should validate both new features and backward compatibility

### Edge Cases
- What happens when comparing dates with very large timestamp differences that might cause overflow?
- How does the system handle comparison of dates at the boundaries of JavaScript Date range (min/max dates)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept Date objects and numeric timestamps as valid inputs for comparison
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain basic chronological ordering functionality (no advanced comparison modes required)
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing compare function API
- **FR-005**: System MUST default to ascending order when the third argument is omitted or undefined
- **FR-006**: System MUST accept case-insensitive order parameters (e.g., "asc", "ASC", "desc", "DESC")
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle edge cases at JavaScript Date boundaries gracefully
- **FR-008**: System MUST use local time representation for all date comparisons (preserving current behavior)
- **FR-009**: System MUST optimize for arrays up to 10,000 dates with sort completion under 100ms
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain current chronological comparison logic without additional complexity

### Documentation and Testing Requirements
- **FR-012**: System MUST include comprehensive test cases for new input types (Date | number) covering all comparison scenarios
- **FR-013**: System MUST include test cases for case-insensitive order parameters ("asc", "ASC", "desc", "DESC")
- **FR-014**: System MUST include test cases for default behavior when third argument is omitted
- **FR-015**: Documentation MUST be updated to reflect the enhanced compare function signature and behavior
- **FR-016**: README.md MUST be updated with examples showing new input types and case-insensitive usage
- **FR-017**: API documentation MUST be regenerated to include the enhanced function signature and parameters

### Key Entities
- **ComparisonOptions**: Configuration object specifying precision level, comparison strategy, and additional parameters
- **ComparisonResult**: Enhanced result that may include additional metadata beyond simple -1/0/1 values
- **DateInput**: Union type representing all acceptable date input formats (Date, number)
- **OrderParameter**: Case-insensitive union type for sort order specification ("asc" | "ASC" | "desc" | "DESC")
- **TestSuite**: Comprehensive test cases covering new input types, case-insensitive parameters, and default behaviors
- **DocumentationSet**: Updated user-facing documentation including README.md, API docs, and usage examples
