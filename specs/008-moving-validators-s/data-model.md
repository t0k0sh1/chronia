# Data Model: Moving Validators Test Code

**Feature**: 008-moving-validators-s | **Date**: 2025-09-27

## Overview

This feature involves reorganizing test file location within the project structure. The primary entities are file system objects and their relationships within the testing infrastructure.

## Entities

### TestFile
**Description**: The validator test file that needs to be moved

**Fields**:
- `currentPath: string` - Current location (`src/_lib/validators.test.ts`)
- `targetPath: string` - Target location (`tests/_lib/validators.test.ts`)
- `content: string` - Test file content (281 lines)
- `importStatements: string[]` - Import dependencies that need updating
- `testCases: number` - Number of test cases (48)

**Validation Rules**:
- Current path must exist and be readable
- Target directory must exist or be creatable
- Content must remain unchanged except for import paths
- All test cases must continue to pass after move

**State Transitions**:
1. `Located` → `ReadyToMove` (after validation)
2. `ReadyToMove` → `Moved` (after file operation)
3. `Moved` → `Validated` (after test verification)

### SourceFile
**Description**: The validator source file being tested

**Fields**:
- `path: string` - Location (`src/_lib/validators.ts`)
- `exports: string[]` - Exported functions (`isValidDate`, `isValidNumber`, `isValidDateOrNumber`)
- `relativePath: string` - Path relative to test file after move

**Validation Rules**:
- Source file must remain in current location
- Exports must remain accessible from new test file location
- Import path calculation must be correct

### DirectoryStructure
**Description**: File system organization for tests

**Fields**:
- `sourceDir: string` - Source directory (`src/_lib/`)
- `testDir: string` - Test directory (`tests/_lib/`)
- `exists: boolean` - Whether directory structure exists
- `pattern: string` - Naming pattern for test files

**Validation Rules**:
- Test directory must exist or be creatable
- Directory structure must follow established patterns
- Permissions must allow file creation

**Relationships**:
- TestFile belongs to DirectoryStructure
- TestFile imports from SourceFile
- DirectoryStructure mirrors source directory structure

### TestRunner
**Description**: Test execution environment and configuration

**Fields**:
- `framework: string` - Test framework (`Vitest`)
- `discoveryPattern: string` - Pattern for finding tests
- `configPath: string` - Configuration file location
- `coverage: object` - Test coverage metrics

**Validation Rules**:
- Test runner must discover moved test file
- All test cases must continue to pass
- Coverage metrics must be preserved

## Implementation Mapping

### Current State
```typescript
// src/_lib/validators.test.ts
import { isValidDate, isValidNumber, isValidDateOrNumber } from "./validators";
```

### Target State
```typescript
// tests/_lib/validators.test.ts
import { isValidDate, isValidNumber, isValidDateOrNumber } from "../../src/_lib/validators";
```

## Data Invariants

1. **Test Content Preservation**: Test logic remains identical
2. **Test Count Preservation**: All 48 test cases remain
3. **Import Resolution**: New import path correctly resolves to source file
4. **Directory Pattern**: Follows existing `tests/_lib/` pattern
5. **Test Discovery**: Test runner finds and executes moved tests
6. **Coverage Preservation**: Test coverage metrics remain unchanged

## File System Operations

### Move Operation
```
Source: /src/_lib/validators.test.ts
Target: /tests/_lib/validators.test.ts
Operation: Move with content modification (import path update)
```

### Validation Steps
1. Verify source file exists and is readable
2. Verify target directory exists
3. Calculate correct relative import path
4. Update import statements in content
5. Write file to target location
6. Remove file from source location
7. Verify test runner can discover and execute tests

## Relationships

```
TestFile
├── imports from → SourceFile (via updated relative path)
├── belongs to → DirectoryStructure (tests/_lib/)
└── executed by → TestRunner (Vitest)

DirectoryStructure
├── mirrors → SourceStructure (src/_lib/)
└── follows → NamingPattern (*.test.ts)

TestRunner
├── discovers → TestFile (in tests/ directory)
├── executes → TestCases (48 total)
└── reports → Coverage (maintained)
```

## Constraints

### File System Constraints
- Target directory must exist or be creatable
- File permissions must allow read/write operations
- No naming conflicts with existing files

### Testing Constraints
- All test cases must continue to pass
- Test discovery must work automatically
- Import resolution must be successful
- Coverage metrics must be preserved

### Project Constraints
- Follow established directory patterns
- Maintain consistency with other test files
- No breaking changes to test functionality
