# Feature Specification: Moving Validators Test Code

**Feature Branch**: `008-moving-validators-s`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "moving validators's test code"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the Chronia library, I need the validator functions' test code to be organized in the standard testing directory structure to maintain consistency with other library components and improve test discoverability and maintainability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** validator test code is currently located in the source directory, **When** I reorganize the test structure, **Then** validator tests should be located in the dedicated tests directory following the same pattern as other function tests
2. **Given** the library has a consistent testing structure, **When** I look for validator tests, **Then** I should find them in the expected location alongside other test files
3. **Given** the tests are moved to the proper location, **When** the test suite runs, **Then** all validator tests should continue to pass without any changes to their behavior
4. **Given** the reorganized test structure, **When** new developers work on the project, **Then** they should easily understand where to find and place test files

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the test runner doesn't find the moved test files?
- How do we ensure no test files are lost during the move?
- What if import paths in the test files need to be updated?
- How do we maintain test coverage after the reorganization?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST move validator test files from source directory to the dedicated tests directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all existing test cases without modification to test logic
- **FR-003**: System MUST update import paths in test files to correctly reference the validator source files
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all moved tests continue to pass in the test suite
- **FR-005**: System MUST follow the established naming convention for test files in the tests directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve test coverage metrics after the reorganization
- **FR-007**: System MUST update any build or CI configuration that might reference the old test file locations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Validator Test Files**: Test files containing test cases for validator functions (isValidDate, isValidNumber, isValidDateOrNumber)
- **Source Directory Structure**: Current location of test files within the source code directory
- **Tests Directory Structure**: Target location following the established pattern for other library component tests
- **Test Runner Configuration**: Configuration that determines how and where test files are discovered and executed
