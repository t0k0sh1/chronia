# Feature Specification: Consistent Argument Validation for clamp Function

**Feature Branch**: `011-make-the-handling`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "make the handling of clamp function aruments consistent with other functions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature identified: Standardize argument validation in clamp function
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Library users (developers)
   � Actions: Validate arguments using standard validators
   � Data: Date/number arguments (date, minDate, maxDate)
   � Constraints: Must align with validation patterns in other functions (addDays, max, min)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � No significant ambiguities - pattern is clear from existing codebase
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Identified scenarios where inconsistent validation causes confusion
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � All requirements are testable and derived from existing patterns
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Primary entity: clamp function with three date/number arguments
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   � No implementation details in requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a library user, I expect all date manipulation functions to validate input arguments consistently. When I pass invalid arguments to the clamp function, it should handle them the same way as other similar functions (like addDays, max, and min) do - validating arguments first, then converting them.

Currently, the clamp function converts arguments first and validates after conversion. This is the opposite order compared to other functions (like addDays which validates first), which creates confusion and makes the library harder to maintain and understand.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer passes an invalid date to clamp, **When** the function processes it, **Then** it should validate the argument first (before any conversion), using the same validation logic as addDays.

2. **Given** a developer passes a valid Date or number to clamp, **When** the function processes the argument, **Then** it should validate first, then convert, in the same order as other date manipulation functions.

3. **Given** a developer passes a non-finite number (NaN, Infinity) to clamp, **When** the function validates the argument, **Then** it should reject it immediately during validation (before conversion) and return Invalid Date, consistent with other functions.

4. **Given** a developer reads the codebase, **When** they review the processing order across functions, **Then** they should find all functions follow the same pattern: validate arguments first, then convert/process them.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when clamp receives null, undefined, or other non-date/number values?
  - Should return Invalid Date, using the same validation logic as other functions

- What happens when clamp receives Infinity or -Infinity as timestamps?
  - Should return Invalid Date, as the validation approach rejects non-finite numbers

- What happens when clamp receives an object that is not a Date instance?
  - Should return Invalid Date, as the validation approach checks for proper Date instances

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The clamp function MUST validate all arguments (date, minDate, maxDate) using the same validation approach as other date manipulation functions.

- **FR-002**: The clamp function MUST validate arguments BEFORE converting them to Date objects, following the same order as the addDays function (validate first, convert second).

- **FR-003**: The clamp function MUST reject non-finite numbers (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity) in the same manner as other functions that accept number arguments.

- **FR-004**: The argument validation behavior MUST produce identical results for the same invalid inputs across clamp, addDays, max, and min functions.

- **FR-005**: The validation logic MUST be consistent - all date/number accepting functions should use the same centralized validation approach.

### Key Entities

- **clamp function**: Accepts three arguments (date, minDate, maxDate), each can be either a Date or a number. Currently converts arguments first, then validates - which is the opposite order compared to other similar functions.

- **Validation pattern**: The established processing order used by addDays function:
  - Step 1: Validate arguments in their original form (Date or number)
  - Step 2: Convert to Date objects only after validation passes
  - Step 3: Process the validated and converted values
  - Return Invalid Date immediately if validation fails

- **Standard validation approach**: A centralized validation system that:
  - Validates Date instances
  - Validates finite numbers (excluding NaN, Infinity, -Infinity)
  - Can validate either Date or number types
