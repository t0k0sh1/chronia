# Feature Specification: isBetween with BetweenOption

**Feature Branch**: `001-isbetween-opts-betweenoption`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "isBetween�pkopts: BetweenOption���W�L�+��+~jDn6����Y�"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the date utility library, I need to check if a date falls between two other dates with precise control over whether the boundary dates should be included or excluded in the comparison, so that I can handle various business logic requirements such as checking if an event is within a date range, validating membership periods, or determining overlapping time intervals.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a target date and a date range with inclusive boundaries, **When** checking if the target date equals the start boundary, **Then** the function returns true
2. **Given** a target date and a date range with exclusive boundaries, **When** checking if the target date equals the start boundary, **Then** the function returns false
3. **Given** a target date and a date range with start-inclusive and end-exclusive boundaries, **When** checking if the target date equals the end boundary, **Then** the function returns false
4. **Given** a target date between two dates with any boundary configuration, **When** the target is strictly within the range, **Then** the function returns true
5. **Given** a target date outside a date range with any boundary configuration, **When** checking if the date is between, **Then** the function returns false

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the start date is after the end date?
- How does system handle when only one boundary option is specified?
- What is the default behavior when no options are provided?
- How does the function handle invalid date inputs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept an optional configuration object to control boundary inclusion behavior
- **FR-002**: System MUST support four boundary configurations: both inclusive, both exclusive, start inclusive/end exclusive, start exclusive/end inclusive
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility by defaulting to "()" (both boundaries exclusive)
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that the start date is not after the end date
- **FR-005**: System MUST return false for any date comparison when invalid dates are provided
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to specify boundary inclusion for the start date independently from the end date
- **FR-007**: System MUST accept a "bounds" property that uses mathematical interval notation: "()" for exclusive, "[]" for inclusive, "[)" for start-inclusive/end-exclusive, "(]" for start-exclusive/end-inclusive

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **BetweenOption**: Configuration object that controls how boundary dates are treated in the comparison, containing a "bounds" property that accepts values "()", "[)", "(]", or "[]" using mathematical interval notation where parentheses indicate exclusion and square brackets indicate inclusion
- **Date Range**: Conceptual entity representing a period between two dates with configurable boundary behaviors
